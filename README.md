# Image Inpainting Using GAN

Given a ground truth image and a binary mask, the goal of an image inpainting GAN is to learn how to restore masked images into semantically correct images. This repository specifically contains my experiment codes for my master thesis.

The experiment is executed in a slurm cluster via the following command:
```
sbatch exec_slurm.sh
```
